{"name":"LIBP - Least Interference Beaconing Protocol","tagline":"Implementation of the Least Interference Beaconing Protocol for Contiki OS","body":"Least Interferance Beaconing Protocol\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\nThe Least Interferance Beaconing Protocol (LIBP) is a routing protocol designed for Low Powered and Lossy Networks (LLNs).\r\n\r\nThis routing protocol, like CTP, uses a beaconing process initiated by the source (sink) node. When \r\nthe process is initiated nodes incident to the sink node will be the first to recognize that\r\na sink node is within one hop distance. This process is then initiated by these nodes to their\r\nneighbors and this process is repeated thereafter. This results in a network where each node is aware of its\r\nneighbors. The least interference paradigm is integrated into the process by which nodes select\r\nparent nodes which have the smallest number of (supporting) children, which is the parent of least\r\ntraffic flow interference. This configuration is especially powerful in the situation where sensors\r\nare periodically sensing information (which is a very popular sensor use case).\r\nLIBP basically aims to provide a way to balance traffic flow in such a way that it results in\r\nenergy efficiency by having a network where nodes support less traffic. \r\n\r\nResearch\r\n========\r\n\r\nThis implementation of LIBP is intended for research purposes. This implementation of LIBP has been\r\ncompared against two other popular wireless sensor network routing protocol, that being RPL and CTP. further\r\nresults will be shown here after the work gets published.\r\n\r\nThis LIBP implementation has been built for ContikiOS. To implement this LIBP, the CTP code from Contiki was forked and\r\nmodified in order to conform to the LIBP paradigm. LIBP runs ontop of Rime. The lightweight communications protocol of Contiki.\r\n\r\nContiki\r\n=======\r\n\r\nContiki is an open source operating system that runs on tiny low-power\r\nmicrocontrollers and makes it possible to develop applications that\r\nmake efficient use of the hardware while providing standardized\r\nlow-power wireless communication for a range of hardware platforms.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the Contiki website:\r\n\r\n[http://contiki-os.org](http://contiki-os.org)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
